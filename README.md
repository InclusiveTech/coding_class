# Coding Class Slides and Editor Environment

Currently there are two curriculums in this folder:

## JavaScript & APIs

This is the default curriculum available at [timetocode.co.uk](http://timetocode.co.uk).
Resources for it are at [timetocode.co.uk/resources.html](http://timetocode.co.uk/resources.html).
A guide for instructors is at [timetocode.co.uk/instructors.html](http://timetocode.co.uk/instructors.html).

## Introductory HTML & CSS

There is a second curriculum, focused on basic HTML & CSS, available at [timetocode.co.uk/curriculum-2.html](http://timetocode.co.uk/curriculum-2.html).
It was added quickly in advanced of a class, and I'd recommend the following improvements:
- Refactor slide_controllers.js to take a choice of curriculum depending on argument/url (so that we don't need two separate slide_controller js files!)
- Make timetocode.uk a landing page that links to the curriculum options, resources and instructor guide
- Update instructor guide to support the HTML & CSS curriculum too
